# Photo Randomizer

## Project Requirements & Prompt

**Language/framework:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

**Requirements:** Create a simple web app that accomplishes the following:

1. When the app starts, fetch /photos JSON data from the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com website
2. Create a horizontally scrollable list of photos that represent the data you fetched. Each photo should have the “title” text written diagonally across the photo, have rounded corners, a border, and should have a drop shadow.  This should scroll smoothly.
3. The photos that are downloaded must be cached so that if the app is terminated, the next session should not have to download previously downloaded images again.
4. Add a button to the screen below the scrollable photo list. Tapping this button will reorder the list in completely random order. Use a recursive function to reorder the list.
